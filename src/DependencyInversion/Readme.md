# Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle is one of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

## Advantages:

1. **Flexibility:**
   - Allows for easily swapping implementations without affecting higher-level modules.

2. **Decoupling:**
   - Reduces tight coupling between classes, promoting a more modular and maintainable codebase.

3. **Testability:**
   - Facilitates easier unit testing by enabling the use of mock objects and dependency injection.

4. **Adaptability:**
   - Supports changes in requirements by making it simpler to introduce new implementations or modify existing ones.

## Usage:

To adhere to the Dependency Inversion Principle, design systems where abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) define the interactions between components, and concrete implementations depend on these abstractions.
