# Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open-Closed Principle is one of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## Advantages:

1. **Maintainability:**
   - Allows for adding new functionality without altering existing code.

2. **Scalability:**
   - Facilitates the creation of new modules without affecting the existing ones.

3. **Reduced Risk:**
   - Changes in existing code are minimized, reducing the risk of introducing new bugs.

4. **Code Reusability:**
   - Promotes the reuse of existing, well-tested code when extending functionality.

## Usage:

To adhere to the Open-Closed Principle, ensure that new features are added through extension (e.g., new subclasses) rather than modification of existing classes.
