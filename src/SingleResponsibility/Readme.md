Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. This principle suggests that a class should encapsulate one and only one functionality or feature.
If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to understand, maintain, and change, and it violates the principle of high cohesion.
