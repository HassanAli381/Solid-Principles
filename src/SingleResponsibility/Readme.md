# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. This principle suggests that a class should encapsulate one and only one functionality or feature.

If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes more difficult to understand, maintain, and change, and it violates the principle of high cohesion.

## Advantages of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

1. **Improved Maintainability:** 
   - Modular code allows for easier updates without affecting unrelated parts of the system.

2. **Easier Testing:** 
   - Focused, single-responsibility classes simplify the testing process, enhancing overall code quality.

3. **Enhanced Readability:** 
   - Classes with clear responsibilities contribute to a more readable and understandable codebase.
