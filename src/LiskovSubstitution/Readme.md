# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle is one of the SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. It states that objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Advantages:

1. **Maintainability:**
   - Enables easy extension of systems with new classes without breaking existing functionality.

2. **Interchangeability:**
   - Objects of derived classes can be used interchangeably with objects of the base class, providing flexibility.

3. **Polymorphism:**
   - Promotes the use of polymorphism, allowing for more generic and reusable code.

4. **Behavior Consistency:**
   - Ensures that derived classes maintain the expected behavior of the base class, enhancing code predictability.

## Usage:

To adhere to the Liskov Substitution Principle, ensure that subclasses can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.
